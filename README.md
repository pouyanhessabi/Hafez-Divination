# Hafez Divination
An android application for Mobile Programming Course at Amirkabir University of Technology. Implemented a basic app to see poem randomly using `kotlin`.<br>
In this program, when entering, there is an option at the bottom of the screen to get a horoscope. By pressing it, one of Hafez's poems entered in the program is randomly selected and displayed to the user. The user can get another fortune by pressing that button again.<br>
Also, next to the fortune telling button, there should be another button called "About the program" that provides general information about the program, such as the version number and its author.
